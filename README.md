🌱 Eco Page: Empowering Sustainability through Technology 🌍

I am thrilled to introduce "Eco Page," a collaborative web application developed by our dedicated team to promote environmental sustainability and community engagement. 🌿

Project Highlights:

🌎 Environmental Impact: Eco Page encourages responsible waste disposal by allowing users to submit their waste items and earn credits for every kilogram recycled. It's a small step toward a greener planet.

💡 Technology Stack: Leveraging Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and MySQL, Eco Page offers a seamless and user-friendly experience.

♻️ Credit System: Users are rewarded with credits for their eco-conscious efforts. This gamification element not only motivates users but also raises awareness about waste reduction.

📊 Database Management: MySQL ensures efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling us to keep track of waste submissions and user credits.

🌐 Web Development: The project showcases our collective skills in front-end (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript) and back-end (Flask and MySQL) development.

🚀 Hosting: Eco Page is live and hosted for real-world use, demonstrating our ability to deploy web applications.

📢 Community Engagement: By fostering a sense of responsibility and reward, Eco Page brings people together for a common cause: protecting our environment.

We're passionate about using technology to make a positive impact, and Eco Page is a testament to our collective commitment. I invite you to explore the project and share your thoughts. Let's work together to create a more sustainable future! 🌟
